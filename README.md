```

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. **Download or clone** this repository.
2. Ensure the **dice images (dice1.png to dice6.png)** are inside the `images/` folder.
3. Open `index.html` in a browser.
4. **Refresh the page** to roll the dice and determine the winner!

## 🎮 Game Logic
- The script generates **two random numbers (1-6)**.
- Updates the **dice images** based on these numbers.
- Compares values and updates the **h1 text**:
  - "🚩 Player 1 Wins!" if Player 1's dice is higher.
  - "Player 2 Wins! 🚩" if Player 2's dice is higher.
  - "It's a Draw! 🎲" if both dice are equal.
